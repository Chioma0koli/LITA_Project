### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of the E commerce paroject over the past years. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insights to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources

  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
  
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
