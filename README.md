### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past years. By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insights to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of Data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open online source such as Kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
  
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables

EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
